# TODO

* Episode-level cover art does not seem to display on Apple Podcasts. Are we doing something wrong? 
* Finish adding all language codes
* Episode publicationTime requires two-digit hours, so "03:12" not "3:12". Is that easy to remedy?
* Podcasts should validate the uniqueness of episode UIDs.
